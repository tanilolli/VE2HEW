Finally had some time to install the loop outside. I was very impressed with it when I had it in prototype form indoors, but moving it outside really made a huge difference. The noise floor dropped, and sensitivity went through the roof on higher bands. There are signals I hear on the loop that don't exist on my transmit antenna.
